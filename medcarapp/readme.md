## General info

This is my first mobile application, I wrote it to learn some Front-end technologies and tools.
It's main four purposes are: 
- making appointments with doctor
- registering entries for visits
- give access to personal calendar
- medical history

Project uses Firebase as a backend and database. Application also uses native technology - NFC, for registering patients entries for the visists. 

## Technologies
* Typescript
* Angular 10.0.8
* Ionic 5.3.2
* Firebase
* NFC
